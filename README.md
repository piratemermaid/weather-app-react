# React Weather App

### About

This app displays a week's weather forecast based on the input city using OpenWeatherMap API. It also color-codes each day's panel based on the temperature.

### Future Ideas

-User can input zip code or city name

-Calling the API by the ID and not the city name, which would allow for better input checking

-Suggested locations as user is typing

### Boilerplate

I used Stephen Grider's boilerplate:
